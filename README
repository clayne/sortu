Sortu Utility

The sortu program is a replacement for the sort and uniq programs.
It is common for Unix script writers to want to count how many
separate patterns are in a file.  For example, if you have a list of
addresses, you may want to see how many are from each state.  So you
cut out the state part, sort these, and then pass them through uniq
-c.  Sortu does all this for you in a fraction of the time.

Sortu uses a hash table and some decent line processing to provide
this functionality. It has some basic field and delimiter handling
which should do most basic awk or cut features to separate out the
field that you are sorting on.
